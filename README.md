# Email Automation (Work in Progress)
*(using Mainly for Gmail)*

*Python Version: 3.83*

In this small project I created a script that will automate the process of sending emails. With this code you can:
* Send plain text messages
* Attach files
* Send multiple emails

The purpose of this code was to help a family member send daily attendance for their classroom. In this version of the program, They just need to provide the file name that needs to be sent
(If you are attaching a file to your email, make sure it is located in the same directory as the script)(This will be changed for any path provided later on)


# Set Up

In order to properly run this code you will need to set up your environment properly.
* You need to make sure that Python is in your [Windows Path variable](https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/)
* For mac users [Python to Path variable](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-the-path-variable-in-mac)
* You also need to allow less secure apps to use your account. You can find that option in the Security section of your google account

* If you want to skip the process of having to constantly enter your password, you can save it as a User Environment Variable using the variable names:
  * EMAIL_USER this should store your username
  * EMAIL_PASS this should store your password
 
  * If you want to you could add them directly to the code but that is not recommended for security purposes
